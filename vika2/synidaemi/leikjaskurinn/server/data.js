            "The Nintendo 64 video game console has a library of games, which were primarily released in plastic ROM cartridges. Two small indentations on the back of each cartridge allows it to connect or pass through the system's cartridge dustcover flaps. All regions have the same connectors, and region-locked cartridges will fit into the other regions' systems by using a cartridge converter or by simply removing the cartridge's casing. However, the systems are also equipped with lockout chips that will only allow them to play their appropriate games. Both Japanese and North American systems have the same NTSC lockout, while Europe has a PAL lockout. A bypass device such as the N64 Passport or the Datel Action Replay can be used to play import titles, but a few games require an additional boot code before they can be played.",

As in the original games, the player controls the Italian plumber Mario and his brother Luigi through themed worlds, collecting power-ups, avoiding obstacles, and finding secret areas. Changes include the addition of parallax scrolling and modified game physics, while some glitches are fixed.",

            'Mario Kart 64 is more than your usual racing game. It’s a Battle Royale on wheels. All of the skill in the world isn’t going to save you or your spot in first place when some punk decides to fire a Blue shell your way. Beneath its colorful, cartoonish appearance, there lies a game so brutal it makes Mad Max look like bumper cars. This successor to Super Mario Kart was able to ditch the Mode 7 graphics for genuine 3D racetracks. With a grand total of 16 increasingly-challenging courses, crisscrossing every corner of the Mushroom Kingdom, and 8 playable Mario veterans behind the wheel, Mario Kart 64 is a title that never runs out of surprises. Whether it’s making hairpin turns on slippery ice sheets, dodging the crushing Thwomps that line the halls of Bowser’s castle, or stealing victory at the last second with a well-timed Mega Mushroom Speed Boost, Mario Kart 64 is loaded with peril at every turn. But even if you managed to master all the dastardly racetracks of the main game, Mario Kart 64’s Battle Mode is guaranteed to leave you with a white-knuckled grip on your controller. Forget about momentum; this game mode is four sadistic speedways designed to let you wreck anything that moves. So if you’re looking for a crash course in why the Nintendo 64 was the greatest multiplayer console ever made, look no further. Get some friends together and get ready to burn some serious rubber in this rip-roaring, road-rage rampage!',
